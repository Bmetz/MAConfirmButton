h1. MAConfirmButton

MAConfirmButton is an animated subclass of UIButton that replicates and improves upon the behavior of the AppStore "Buy Now" buttons.

h2. Usage

I attempted to make this class as "drop-in" as possible with regards to it being a subclass of UIButton.

h3. Init

<pre>
+ (MAConfirmButton *)buttonWithTitle:(NSString *)t confirm:(NSString *)c;
+ (MAConfirmButton *)buttonWithDisabledTitle:(NSString *)t;
</pre>

h3. Anchor

It is important that the anchor be set. For now, the anchor is the top right.

<pre>
- (void)setAnchor:(CGPoint)a;
</pre>

h3. Change State

<pre>
- (void)disableWithTitle:(NSString *)t;
</pre>
