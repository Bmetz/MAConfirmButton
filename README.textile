h1. MAConfirmButton

MAConfirmButton is an animated subclass of UIButton that replicates and improves upon the behavior of the AppStore "Buy Now" buttons.

h2. Usage

I attempted to make this class as "drop-in" as possible since it is, after all, a subclass of UIButton. Your project must include the **QuartzCore** framework.

h3. Init

<pre>
+ (MAConfirmButton *)buttonWithTitle:(NSString *)disabledString confirm:(NSString *)confirmString;
+ (MAConfirmButton *)buttonWithDisabledTitle:(NSString *)disabledString;
</pre>

h3. Anchor

It is important that the anchor be set in order to position this button. Instead of using `setFrame:` after initializing the button, simply. For now, the anchor point is the **top right** and the button is always aligned right, like the AppStore.

<pre>
- (void)setAnchor:(CGPoint)anchor;
</pre>

h3. Change State

<pre>
- (void)disableWithTitle:(NSString *)disabledString;
</pre>
